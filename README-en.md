# DIEC OpenSearch

An OpenSearch description file for the DIEC Catalan dictionary. So that I can add it as a search engine in Firefox.

## Usage

- Open [the webpage](https://victor-gp.github.io/diec-opensearch/) for this (it's ok if it's blank).
- Add the search engine following [these instructions for Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox#w_add-a-search-engine-from-the-search-bar)
- Go to <about:preferences#search> and add a search shortcut for this engine. You can choose 'diec', 'ca', 'cat', whatever you want.
